# Corrected-Unit-One-Homework

## Description:
A marketing agency has hired us to refactor their existing codebase in order to follow accessibility standards which will then optimize their site in search engines. 

## Refactoring changes made in HTML and CSS files:
    * Non-semantic elements changed to semantic elements, i.e. div changed to header
    * Redundant classes then deleted in HTML and adjusted in CSS, i.e. <div class="header"> changed to <header> in HTML and .header changed to header in css
    * HTML elements in logical order
    * Accessible alt attributes added to images
    * Heading attributes placed in sequential order: h1 in the header and starting at h2 in the body (i.e. changed h3 in the 3 aside sections to h2)
    * Concise title element added
    * CSS placed in order of appearance on HTML sheet
